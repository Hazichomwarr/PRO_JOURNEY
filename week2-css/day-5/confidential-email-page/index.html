        <p class="text">Dear Agent <span class="blurred" aria-hidden="true">Hamza</span></p>
        <p class="text">We have an emergency. The secret formula for our <span class="blurred" aria-hidden="true"> Mega Marshmallow </span> has been compromised. This formula is what makes our marshmallows the fluffiest and most delicious.
        </p>
        <p class="text">We suspect that <span class="blurred" aria-hidden="true">Professor Puff</span> is behind this. He has taken the formula to his hidden laboratory. Your mission is to infiltrate the lab and secure the formula before it's too late.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Be sure to keep the lab's location confidential. Any leak of this information could jeopardize the entire operation.
