# Day - 4: The Core Principle: Structure first, style second

Geometry defines structural hierarchy, while fonts and colors define stylistic hierarchy — structure must be correct before style is applied

## Geometry answers:

- What is primary vs secondary
- What attracts attention first
- What occupies more visual weight
- How the layout flows

## Style answers:

- How it looks emotionally
- Brand identity
- Tone

> If structure is wrong, no amount of styling fixes it.

## Example:

- Bad geometry + fancy style = still bad UI
- Good geometry + plain style = already good UI

> That’s why most professional sites look good even in grayscale.
> **Because their geometry is correct.**

## Summary

Geometry = architecture
Style = paint

You don’t paint before building the structure.

> Area > position > contrast > typography.
