# UI Constraint Mastery – 4 Week System

Duration: 4 Weeks  
Daily: 45–60 minutes minimum  
Goal: Remove blank canvas anxiety permanently.

---

# WEEK 1 — Geometry Control

Focus: Width + Grid + Container discipline

Rules:

- > Area > position > contrast > typography.
- max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4
- py-16 for sections
- gap-6 default
- md:grid-cols-2 or md:grid-cols-3 only
- cards always p-6
- CTA button rows should be wrap-safe unless you intentionally want full-width stacked buttons.
- items-center is for split sections (text + media) not for card grids
- Use mt-\* for structural spacing hierarchy.
- Use flex flex-col gap-\* when elements are same structural level.

Daily Tasks:
Day 1 – 3-card grid
Day 2 – 2-column split section
Day 3 – centered text block section
Day 4 – image + text alignment
Day 5 – 4-card grid
Day 6 – hero layout
Day 7 – combine 3 sections into one mini page

Constraint:
NO creative spacing allowed.

# WEEK 2 — Vertical Rhythm

Focus: Spacing intelligence

Rules:

- Title → Paragraph: mt-4
- Paragraph → Button: mt-6 or mt-8
- Paragraph → content: mt-12 (if content is a grid/split block)
- Inside card: title → description: mt-2
- Limit text width: max-w-2xl or 3xl
- 2-column text group → max-w-xl (text inside a column)
- Section header (full-width context) → max-w-2xl
- max-w-3xl = centered statements / manifesto blocks.
- Section stacking must breathe

---

Focus: Background = full width & Content = constrained width

Rules:

- Section → background layer (full width)
- Wrapper → content constraint layer
- Layout divs → geometry layer
- Content → typography layer
  **No mixing responsibilities.**

Daily:
Rebuild one section per day.
Adjust spacing only.
No color changes.

Goal:
See imbalance instantly.

# WEEK 3 — Typography Hierarchy

Memorize scale:

Hero:

- text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold

Section Title:

- text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold

Card Title:

- text-lg font-semibold

Paragraph:

- text-base text-neutral-700

Description:

- text-sm text-neutral-600

Goal:
Hierarchy becomes automatic.

1. Hero
2. 3 Pillars Grid
