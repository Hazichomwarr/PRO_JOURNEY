# Mental Algorithms — Emotion → Website (Product Engineer)

## The Canon: 10 questions

1. Outcome: What must change if the site succeeds?
2. Primary action: The #1 thing visitors should do (CTA)?
3. Audience: Top 2–3 visitor types?
4. Belief barriers: What must each audience believe before acting?
5. Story: Who are you + for whom + what do you do + why now?
6. Proof: What evidence builds trust (photos, partners, numbers, testimonials)?
7. Offers/programs: What do you _actually_ provide (events, mentoring, workshops)?
8. Paths: What page sequence should each audience follow to convert?
9. Operations: Who updates content and how often?
10. Constraints: budget, deadline, bilingual, SEO, accessibility, hosting.

## Algorithm A — Flyer → Sitemap (7 steps)

**Input:** raw text / brochure  
**Output:** routes/pages + navigation

1. Extract verbs (actions): valoriser, célébrer, accompagner, organiser...
2. Identify audiences: participants, familles, écoles, sponsors, nouveaux arrivants...
3. Convert verbs into "page intents":
   - trust (about)
   - offer (programs)
   - proof (gallery)
   - conversion (participate/contact)
4. Create a navigation rule:
   - max 5–6 header items
   - depth max 2 (hub → detail)
5. Draft sitemap:
   - hub pages + detail pages + legal pages
6. Attach CTA to each page:
   - About → "Participer"
   - Activities → "S'inscrire / Nous contacter"
   - Gallery → "Voir les activités / Participer"
7. Validate completeness:
   - Can each audience find what they need in ≤ 2 clicks?

## Algorithm B — Audience → Conversion Paths

For each audience type, define:

- Goal (what they want)
- Doubt (what blocks them)
- Proof (what convinces them)
- Path (pages in order)
- CTA (final action)

Example:

- Sponsor:
  - Goal: support + visibility
  - Doubt: legitimacy
  - Proof: partners, photos, impact
  - Path: Home → About → Activities → Partners → Contact
  - CTA: "Devenir partenaire"

## Algorithm C — Page Recipe (works for every page)

Each page should contain:

1. One-line promise (headline)
2. Short explanation (why it matters)
3. Concrete content (what happens / how it works)
4. Proof (photos, quotes, numbers)
5. CTA (what to do next)

## Quality Checklist (fast)

- Header: ≤ 6 items
- Each page: has a clear CTA
- Proof is visible within 1–2 scrolls
- Contact info appears in footer everywhere
- Gallery exists (instant credibility)
