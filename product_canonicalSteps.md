# Canonical questions (the ones that always work)

## 1. Outcome

> If this site works perfectly, what changes? (donations, registrations, calls, credibility, volunteers)
> What is the single most important action a visitor should take?

## 2. Audience

> Who are the top 2–3 visitor types? (newcomer, sponsor, family, school, artist…)
> What does each one need to believe before acting? (trust, legitimacy, impact, safety)

## 3. Core story

> In one sentence: Who are you + for whom + what do you do + why now?
> What proof do you have? (photos, partners, numbers, testimonials, press)

## 4. Content inventory (what exists / what must be created)

> What content do you already have? (flyer, logos, photos, videos, event albums)
> What is missing but required? (mission text, team, bylaws, sponsors, FAQ)

## 5. Offer / programs

> What are your “products” as an association? (events, workshops, mentoring, sport, contests)
> For each program: who it’s for, what happens, frequency, how to join

## 6. Conversion paths

> For each visitor type: what page sequence should they follow?

- Example: Home → Activities → Mentorat → Contact

> What CTAs appear on every page? (Participer, Devenir partenaire, Nous contacter)

## 7. Trust & legitimacy

> What must be visible to feel “real”? (address, phone, legal status, team, partners)
> Any sensitive constraints? (kids photos permission, safeguarding, moderation)

## 8. Navigation rules

> What are the top 5 menu items max?
> What should be “primary” vs “secondary” (footer)?

## 9. Operations / updating

> Who updates the site and how often?
> Do they need an admin area, or just “upload albums” in a simple way?

## 10. Technical scope / constraints

> Deadline, budget, bilingual later?
> Hosting/domain ready? SEO? forms? analytics? accessibility?

That’s the canon: Outcome → Audience → Story → Content → Offers → Paths → Trust → Navigation → Ops → Tech.

## **“mental algorithm”** (à réutiliser sur tous tes gigs)

> Quand tu reçois un flyer / message émotionnel, tu fais:

- Extraire verbes d’action (valoriser, partager, soutenir, accompagner…)
- Déduire audiences (participants, familles, écoles, sponsors, nouveaux arrivants)
- Créer pages = réponses aux besoins (confiance, offre, preuve, action)
- Créer routes = navigation simple + profondeur max 2
- Ajouter CTAs répétées et cohérentes
